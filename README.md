While in high school, I worked on a project called Synesthesia that combined art and computer science. The art component, which is explained on my website, https://www.projectsynesthesia.wordpress.com/, took fundamental physics principles about color and applied them to a data set about sound frequency that I collected to create a data visualization. 

The computer science component continued playing with the idea of visualizing sound data but did so in a kinetic way. The source code for the interactive portion is in this library and the project can be viewed online at https://saralewis-p5.000webhostapp.com/. To try the project, make consistant noises into your computer's microphone and observe the results.
